# clock
A toy clock which works on windows desktop.
There is a little threading trick in the code.
Without the trick, the code exits abnormally.
I think the trick is the only thing this code is worthing being posted on github, oh, and I forgot the lightblue background color and the Digital-7 font, which mimics the look of a real digital clock and can be only properly displayed if installed on the os.
